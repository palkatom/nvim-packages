Given (Some text in buffer):
  line 1
  line 2
  line 3
Execute (Validate that cursorline and colorcolumn are set):
  AssertEqual 1, &cursorline
  Assert index(split(&colorcolumn, ","), "75") < 0
  Assert index(split(&colorcolumn, ","), "80") >= 0
  Assert index(split(&colorcolumn, ","), "85") < 0
  Assert index(split(&colorcolumn, ","), "120") >= 0
  Assert index(split(&colorcolumn, ","), "125") >= 0
  AssertEqual 881, len(split(&colorcolumn, ","))
Execute (Leave window and check that cursorline is not set):
  doautocmd WinLeave
Then (Cursorline is not set and each column is colored):
  AssertEqual 0, &cursorline
  AssertEqual 999, len(split(&colorcolumn, ","))
Execute (Enter window and enable diff):
  doautocmd WinEnter
  AssertEqual 1, &cursorline
  diffthis
Then (Cursorline is not set):
  AssertEqual 0, &cursorline
Execute (Leave window when diff is set):
  doautocmd WinLeave
Then (Cursorline is not set):
  AssertEqual 0, &cursorline
Execute (Enter window when diff is set):
  doautocmd WinEnter
Then (Cursorline is not set):
  AssertEqual 0, &cursorline
Execute (Disable diff):
  diffoff
Then (Cursorline is set):
  AssertEqual 1, &cursorline
